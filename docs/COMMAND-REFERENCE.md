- Current daily spend
- Kill switch status

**Note:** Add jobs with `/octo:schedule`, not this command. This command manages the daemon process only.

## Admin

### `/octo:claw`

OpenClaw instance administration across five platforms.

**Usage:**
```
/octo:claw                              # Auto-detect platform, run diagnostics
/octo:claw update openclaw              # Update OpenClaw to latest stable
/octo:claw harden my server             # Run security hardening checklist
/octo:claw setup openclaw on proxmox    # Guided installation on Proxmox LXC
/octo:claw check gateway health         # Gateway and channel diagnostics
```

**Supported platforms:**

| Platform | What it manages |
|----------|----------------|
| macOS | Homebrew, launchd, Application Firewall, APFS, FileVault |
| Ubuntu/Debian | apt, systemd, ufw, journalctl, unattended-upgrades |
| Docker | docker compose, container health, volumes, log drivers |
| Oracle OCI | ARM instances, VCN/NSG networking, block volumes, Tailscale |
| Proxmox | VMs (qm), LXC containers (pct), ZFS, vzdump, clustering |

**OpenClaw management:**
- Gateway lifecycle: start, stop, restart, status, health, logs
- Diagnostics: `openclaw doctor`, `openclaw security audit`
- Configuration: channels, models, agents, sessions, skills, plugins
- Updates: channel management (stable/beta/dev), backup, rollback

**Natural language triggers:**
- `octo manage my openclaw server`
- `octo harden my server`
- `octo check server health`

## Project Lifecycle (Skill-Based)

These features are triggered by natural language — they are not slash commands. Claude auto-activates them based on context.

### `/octo:status`

Show where you are in the workflow and what to do next.

**Invocation:** Skill-based — triggered by natural language: "show status", "where am I", "what's next", "progress", "what have I been working on"

**Output:**
- Current phase and position
- Roadmap progress with checkmarks
- Active blockers
- Suggested next action

---

### `/octo:resume`

Pick up where you left off from a previous session.

**Invocation:** Skill-based — triggered by: "resume", "continue", "pick up where I left off", "what was I doing", "restore session"

**Behavior:**
1. Reads `.octo/STATE.md` for current position
2. Loads context using adaptive tier
3. Shows restoration summary
4. Suggests next action

---

### `/octo:ship`

Package and finalize completed work for delivery.

**Invocation:** Skill-based — triggered by: "ship", "deliver", "finalize", "I'm done", "complete the project"

**Behavior:**
1. Verifies project is ready (all phases complete)
2. Runs Multi-AI security audit (Codex + Gemini + Claude)
3. Captures lessons learned
4. Archives project state
5. Creates shipped checkpoint

---

### `/octo:issues`

Track blockers, bugs, and gaps across sessions.

**Invocation:** Skill-based — triggered by: "add issue", "show issues", "track this problem", "what issues do we have"

**Subcommands (via natural language):**
- List all open issues
- Add new issue: `add <description>`
- Resolve: `resolve <id>`
- Show details: `show <id>`

**Issue ID format:** `ISS-YYYYMMDD-NNN`

**Severity levels:** critical, high, medium, low

---

### `/octo:rollback`

Roll back to a previous checkpoint via git.

**Invocation:** Skill-based — triggered by: "rollback", "revert", "undo", "go back to", "restore checkpoint"

**Usage:** "rollback to checkpoint X", "list checkpoints", "revert last change"

**Safety:**
- Creates a pre-rollback checkpoint automatically
- Preserves LESSONS.md (never rolled back)
- Requires explicit confirmation before destructive action

## Visual Indicators

When Claude Octopus activates external CLIs, you'll see visual indicators:

| Indicator | Meaning | Provider |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| 🐙 | Multi-AI mode active | Multiple providers |
| 🔴 | Codex CLI executing | OpenAI (your OPENAI_API_KEY) |
| 🟡 | Gemini CLI executing | Google (your GEMINI_API_KEY) |
| 🟣 | Perplexity Sonar search | Your PERPLEXITY_API_KEY |
| 🔵 | Claude subagent | Included with Claude Code |

**Example:**
```
🐙 **CLAUDE OCTOPUS ACTIVATED** - Multi-provider research mode
🔍 Discover Phase: Researching authentication patterns

Providers:
🔴 Codex CLI - Technical implementation analysis
🟡 Gemini CLI - Ecosystem and community research
🔵 Claude - Strategic synthesis
```

📖 See [Visual Indicators Guide](./VISUAL-INDICATORS.md) for details.

## Natural Language Triggers

Instead of slash commands, you can use natural language with the "octo" prefix:

| You Say | Equivalent Command |
|---------|--------------------|
| `octo research OAuth patterns` | `/octo:discover OAuth patterns` |
| `octo build user auth` | `/octo:develop user auth` |
| `octo review my code` | `/octo:review` |
| `octo debate X vs Y` | `/octo:debate X vs Y` |
| `octo plan a new feature` | `/octo:plan new feature` |
| `octo spec out the chat system` | `/octo:spec chat system` |

**Why "octo"?** Common words like "research" or "review" may conflict with Claude's built-in behaviors. The "octo" prefix ensures reliable activation.

📖 See [Triggers Guide](./TRIGGERS.md) for the complete list.
