# State Manager - Session Persistence for Claude Octopus

Provides persistent state tracking across sessions, context resets, and workflow phases.

## Purpose

The state manager enables:
- **Session Resumption**: Continue work after context resets
- **Decision Tracking**: Record and retrieve architectural decisions
- **Blocker Management**: Track impediments across phases
- **Context Preservation**: Pass information between workflow phases
- **Metrics Collection**: Measure execution time and provider usage

## State File Structure

State is stored in `.claude-octopus/state.json`:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "project_id": "unique-hash",
  "current_workflow": "flow-develop",
  "current_phase": "develop",
  "session_start": "2026-01-28T14:30:00Z",
  "decisions": [
    {
      "phase": "define",
      "decision": "React 19 + Next.js 15",
      "rationale": "Modern stack with best DX",
      "date": "2026-01-28",
      "commit": "abc123f"
    }
  ],
  "blockers": [
    {
      "description": "Waiting for API endpoint",
      "phase": "develop",
      "status": "active",
      "created": "2026-01-28"
    }
  ],
  "context": {
    "discover": "researched auth patterns, chose JWT",
    "define": "user wants passwordless magic links",
    "develop": "implementing backend API first",
    "deliver": null
  },
  "metrics": {
    "phases_completed": 2,
    "total_execution_time_minutes": 45,
    "provider_usage": {
      "codex": 12,
      "gemini": 10,
      "claude": 25
    }
  }
}
```

## When to Use

### Use State Manager When:
- ✅ Starting a new workflow (initialize state)
- ✅ Completing a workflow phase (update metrics, context)
- ✅ Making architectural decisions (record decision)
- ✅ Encountering blockers (track impediments)
- ✅ Resuming after context reset (read prior state)
- ✅ Switching between workflows (set current workflow)

### Don't Use State Manager For:
- ❌ Storing code or large content (use files instead)
- ❌ Temporary values within a single session
- ❌ Data that belongs in git commits

## Usage Patterns

### 1. Initialize State (Start of Session)

Before running any workflow:

```bash
"${HOME}/.claude-octopus/plugin/scripts/state-manager.sh" init_state
```

This creates:
- `.claude-octopus/state.json` (state file)
- `.claude-octopus/context/` (phase context files)
- `.claude-octopus/summaries/` (execution summaries)
- `.claude-octopus/quick/` (quick mode outputs)

**Safe to run multiple times** - validates existing state or recreates if corrupted.

### 2. Read State (Pre-Execution)

Before executing a workflow phase, read prior state to understand context:

```bash
# Get full state
state=$("${HOME}/.claude-octopus/plugin/scripts/state-manager.sh" read_state)

# Extract specific information
current_phase=$(echo "$state" | jq -r '.current_phase')
decisions=$(echo "$state" | jq -r '.decisions')
discover_context=$(echo "$state" | jq -r '.context.discover')

# Use this information to scope your work
echo "Previous phase: $current_phase"
echo "Decisions made: $decisions"
echo "Discovery findings: $discover_context"
```

### 3. Record Decision (During Execution)

When making architectural or implementation decisions:

```bash
"${HOME}/.claude-octopus/plugin/scripts/state-manager.sh" write_decision \
  "define" \
  "Use React 19 with Next.js 15 and TypeScript" \
  "Modern stack with best developer experience, Server Components support"
```

**When to Record Decisions:**
- Technology stack choices
- Architectural patterns selected
- Implementation approach
- Design decisions
- Security choices

**When NOT to Record:**
- Implementation details (those go in code)
- Temporary choices
- Obvious defaults

### 4. Update Context (Post-Execution)

After completing a workflow phase, summarize findings:

```bash
"${HOME}/.claude-octopus/plugin/scripts/state-manager.sh" update_context \
  "discover" \
  "Researched authentication patterns: JWT vs session-based. Community prefers JWT for API-first apps. Found 3 battle-tested libraries: jose, jsonwebtoken, auth0. Chose jose for ESM support."
```

**Context Guidelines:**
- **Be concise** (1-3 sentences max)
- **Focus on outcomes**, not process
- **Highlight key findings** that inform next phases
- **Include rationale** for choices

### 5. Track Blockers (As Needed)

When encountering impediments:

```bash
# Record new blocker
"${HOME}/.claude-octopus/plugin/scripts/state-manager.sh" write_blocker \
  "Waiting for API endpoint /auth/login to be deployed" \
  "develop" \
  "active"

# Update blocker when resolved
"${HOME}/.claude-octopus/plugin/scripts/state-manager.sh" update_blocker_status \
  "Waiting for API endpoint /auth/login to be deployed" \
  "resolved"
```

### 6. Update Metrics (Post-Execution)

After executing workflow phases:

```bash
# Increment phase completion counter
"${HOME}/.claude-octopus/plugin/scripts/state-manager.sh" update_metrics \
  "phases_completed" \
  "1"

# Track execution time (in minutes)
"${HOME}/.claude-octopus/plugin/scripts/state-manager.sh" update_metrics \
  "execution_time" \
  "15"

# Track provider usage
"${HOME}/.claude-octopus/plugin/scripts/state-manager.sh" update_metrics \
  "provider" \
  "gemini"
```

### 7. Set Current Workflow (Workflow Start)

At the beginning of each workflow:

```bash
"${HOME}/.claude-octopus/plugin/scripts/state-manager.sh" set_current_workflow \
  "flow-develop" \
  "develop"
```

### 8. Display Summary (Debug/Status Check)

To see current state at a glance:

```bash
"${HOME}/.claude-octopus/plugin/scripts/state-manager.sh" show_summary
```

Output:
```
=== Claude Octopus State Summary ===

Project ID: a3f2c8b9e1d4f7a6
Session Start: 2026-01-28T14:30:00Z
Current Workflow: flow-develop
Current Phase: develop

Metrics:
  Phases Completed: 2
  Execution Time: 45 minutes
  Provider Usage:
    - Codex: 12
    - Gemini: 10
    - Claude: 25

Active Blockers: 1
```

## Integration with Workflows

All Double Diamond flows should integrate state management:

### Pre-Execution (Read State)

```bash
# Initialize if needed
"${HOME}/.claude-octopus/plugin/scripts/state-manager.sh" init_state

# Set current workflow
"${HOME}/.claude-octopus/plugin/scripts/state-manager.sh" set_current_workflow \
  "flow-define" \
  "define"

# Read prior context
discover_findings=$("${HOME}/.claude-octopus/plugin/scripts/state-manager.sh" get_context "discover")

if [ "$discover_findings" != "null" ]; then
  echo "Building on discovery phase findings:"
  echo "$discover_findings"
fi

# Get prior decisions
decisions=$("${HOME}/.claude-octopus/plugin/scripts/state-manager.sh" get_decisions "all")
if [ "$decisions" != "[]" ]; then
  echo "Respecting prior decisions:"
  echo "$decisions" | jq -r '.[] | "- \(.decision) (\(.phase))"'
fi
```

### Post-Execution (Write State)

```bash
# Record key decision made during this phase
"${HOME}/.claude-octopus/plugin/scripts/state-manager.sh" write_decision \
  "$phase_name" \
  "$decision_summary" \
  "$rationale"

# Update context for next phase
"${HOME}/.claude-octopus/plugin/scripts/state-manager.sh" update_context \
  "$phase_name" \
  "$key_findings_summary"

# Update metrics
"${HOME}/.claude-octopus/plugin/scripts/state-manager.sh" update_metrics \
  "phases_completed" \
  "1"

# Track execution time
execution_time=$((end_time - start_time))
"${HOME}/.claude-octopus/plugin/scripts/state-manager.sh" update_metrics \
  "execution_time" \
  "$execution_time"
```

## Error Handling

The state manager includes built-in safety:

### Atomic Writes
- Uses temp file + atomic move to prevent corruption
- Validates JSON before committing
- Backs up state before each write

### Validation
- Checks JSON validity on every read
- Detects corrupted files and recreates
- Graceful degradation if state missing

### Recovery
- Backup saved to `.claude-octopus/state.json.backup`
- Corrupted files moved to `.claude-octopus/state.json.corrupt.<timestamp>`
- Can reinitialize at any time

## Best Practices

### DO:
- ✅ Initialize state at the start of each session
- ✅ Read state before executing workflows
- ✅ Record decisions with clear rationale
- ✅ Update context after each phase
- ✅ Track meaningful metrics
- ✅ Add `.claude-octopus/` to `.gitignore` (state may contain sensitive context)

### DON'T:
- ❌ Store large content in state (use files)
- ❌ Record every minor decision
- ❌ Skip state initialization
- ❌ Manually edit state.json (use CLI)
- ❌ Store sensitive data in state

## Debugging

### Check if state exists:
```bash
if [ -f .claude-octopus/state.json ]; then
  echo "State file exists"
else
  echo "State file missing - run init_state"
fi
```

### Validate state JSON:
```bash
if jq empty .claude-octopus/state.json 2>/dev/null; then
  echo "State file is valid JSON"
else
  echo "State file is corrupted"
fi
```

### View raw state:
```bash
cat .claude-octopus/state.json | jq .
```

### Reset state:
```bash
rm -rf .claude-octopus
"${HOME}/.claude-octopus/plugin/scripts/state-manager.sh" init_state
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Starting a New Feature

```bash
# Initialize state
"${HOME}/.claude-octopus/plugin/scripts/state-manager.sh" init_state

# Run discovery
# ... discovery workflow executes ...

# Record findings
"${HOME}/.claude-octopus/plugin/scripts/state-manager.sh" update_context \
  "discover" \
  "Found 3 auth patterns. JWT preferred for API-first architecture."

# Run definition
# ... definition workflow executes ...

# Record decision
"${HOME}/.claude-octopus/plugin/scripts/state-manager.sh" write_decision \
  "define" \
  "JWT authentication with jose library" \
  "ESM support, actively maintained, follows standards"

# Update context
"${HOME}/.claude-octopus/plugin/scripts/state-manager.sh" update_context \
  "define" \
  "Spec: Passwordless magic links, 15min token expiry, refresh tokens"
```

### Example 2: Resuming After Context Reset

```bash
# Read prior state
state=$("${HOME}/.claude-octopus/plugin/scripts/state-manager.sh" read_state)

# Extract context
echo "$state" | jq -r '.context'
# Output:
# {
#   "discover": "Found 3 auth patterns. JWT preferred...",
#   "define": "Spec: Passwordless magic links...",
#   "develop": null,
#   "deliver": null
# }

# Extract decisions
echo "$state" | jq -r '.decisions'
# Output: Array of decision objects

# Continue from where you left off
current_phase=$(echo "$state" | jq -r '.current_phase')
echo "Resuming from phase: $current_phase"
```

### Example 3: Tracking Blockers

```bash
# Hit a blocker during development
"${HOME}/.claude-octopus/plugin/scripts/state-manager.sh" write_blocker \
  "Need production API keys for auth provider" \
  "develop" \
  "active"

# Later, when unblocked
"${HOME}/.claude-octopus/plugin/scripts/state-manager.sh" update_blocker_status \
  "Need production API keys for auth provider" \
  "resolved"

# Check active blockers
"${HOME}/.claude-octopus/plugin/scripts/state-manager.sh" get_active_blockers
```

## File Structure

State management creates this directory structure:

```
.claude-octopus/
├── state.json                    # Main state file
├── state.json.backup             # Backup before last write
├── context/                      # Phase context files
│   ├── discover-context.md
│   ├── define-context.md
│   ├── develop-context.md
│   └── deliver-context.md
├── summaries/                    # Execution summaries
│   └── flow-develop-20260128-summary.md
└── quick/                        # Quick mode outputs
    └── 20260128-143045-summary.md
```
