# Claude Octopus

**Multi-AI orchestrator for Claude Code** - coordinates Codex, Gemini, and Claude CLIs using Double Diamond methodology.

> *Why have one AI do the work when you can have eight squabble about it productively?* 🐙

## TL;DR

| What It Does | How |
|--------------|-----|
| **Visual feedback** | Know when external CLIs run (🐙 🔴 🟡) vs built-in (🔵) 🆕 |
| **Natural language workflows** | "research X" → probe, "build X" → tangle, "review X" → ink 🆕 |
| **Parallel AI execution** | Run multiple AI models simultaneously |
| **Structured workflows** | Double Diamond: Research → Define → Develop → Deliver |
| **Quality gates** | 75% consensus threshold before delivery |
| **Smart routing** | Auto-detects intent and picks the right AI model |
| **AI Debate Hub** | Structured 3-way debates (Claude + Gemini + Codex) |
| **Adversarial review** | AI vs AI debate catches more bugs |
| **Knowledge work** | UX research, strategy, literature review + document export |

**How to use it:**

Just talk to Claude naturally! Claude Octopus automatically activates when you need multi-AI collaboration:

- 💬 "Research OAuth authentication patterns and summarize the best approaches"
- 💬 "Build a user authentication system"
- 💬 "Review this code for security vulnerabilities"
- 💬 "Run a debate about whether we should use Redis or Memcached"

Claude coordinates multiple AI models behind the scenes to give you comprehensive, validated results.

## Quick Start

Get started with Claude Octopus in 2 simple steps:

### Step 1: Install the Plugin

Open Claude Code and run these two commands in the chat:

```
/plugin marketplace add nyldn/claude-octopus
/plugin install claude-octopus@nyldn-plugins
```

The plugin is now installed and automatically enabled.

<details>
<summary>Troubleshooting Installation</summary>

**If `/claude-octopus:setup` shows "Unknown skill" in Step 2:**

1. Verify the plugin is installed:
   ```
   /plugin list
   ```
   Look for `claude-octopus@nyldn-plugins` in the installed plugins list.

2. Try reinstalling:
   ```
   /plugin uninstall claude-octopus
   /plugin marketplace update nyldn-plugins
   /plugin install claude-octopus@nyldn-plugins
   ```

3. Check for errors in debug logs (from terminal):
   ```bash
   tail -100 ~/.claude/debug/*.txt | grep -i "claude-octopus\|error"
   ```

4. Make sure you're on Claude Code v2.1.10 or later (from terminal):
   ```bash
   claude --version
   ```

</details>

### Step 2: Configure Your AI Providers

Run the setup command in Claude Code:
```
/claude-octopus:setup
```

This will:
- Auto-detect what's already installed
- Show you exactly what you need (you only need ONE provider!)
- Give you shell-specific instructions
- Verify your setup when done

**No terminal context switching needed** - Claude guides you through everything!

### Step 3: Start Using It

Just talk to Claude naturally! Claude Octopus automatically activates when you need multi-AI collaboration:

**For research:**
> "Research microservices patterns and compare their trade-offs"

**For development:**
> "Build a REST API for user management with authentication"

**For code review:**
> "Review my authentication code for security issues"

**For debates:**
> "Run a debate about whether we should use GraphQL or REST for our API"

Claude Octopus automatically detects which providers you have and uses them intelligently.

## 🆕 What's New in v7.5 - Command Organization & Autocomplete

**Commands now appear in autocomplete!** v7.5 fixes command discovery with proper YAML frontmatter and organized naming.

### Available Commands

All commands use the `/claude-octopus:` namespace and appear in autocomplete:

| Command | Description | Category |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| `/claude-octopus:setup` | Check setup status | System ✅ |
| `/claude-octopus:update` | Check for updates | System ✅ |
| `/claude-octopus:km` | Toggle knowledge mode | Mode switching ✅ |
| `/claude-octopus:sys-setup` | Full name for setup | System ✅ |

## What's New in v7.4 - Visual Feedback & Natural Language Workflows

**Now you always know what's running!** v7.4 adds visual indicators and natural language workflow triggers.

### Visual Indicators

See exactly which AI is responding:

| Indicator | Meaning | Provider | Cost |
|-----------|---------|----------|------|
| 🐙 | **Parallel Mode** | Multiple CLIs orchestrated | Uses external APIs |
| 🔴 | **Codex CLI** | OpenAI Codex | Your OPENAI_API_KEY |
| 🟡 | **Gemini CLI** | Google Gemini | Your GEMINI_API_KEY |
| 🔵 | **Claude Subagent** | Claude Code Task tool | Included with Claude Code |

**Example:**
```
User: Research authentication best practices

Claude:
🐙 **CLAUDE OCTOPUS ACTIVATED** - Multi-provider research mode
🔍 Probe Phase: Researching authentication patterns

Providers:
🔴 Codex CLI - Technical implementation analysis
🟡 Gemini CLI - Ecosystem and community research
🔵 Claude - Strategic synthesis

[Multi-provider research results...]
```

**Why this matters:** External CLIs cost money (your API quotas). Visual indicators help you understand costs.

📖 **[Complete Visual Indicators Guide →](docs/VISUAL-INDICATORS.md)**

### Natural Language Workflow Triggers

No more CLI commands! Just talk naturally:

| You Say | What Triggers | Indicator |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| "research X" | Probe workflow (discover) | 🐙 🔍 |
| "define requirements for X" | Grasp workflow (define) | 🐙 🎯 |
| "build X" | Tangle workflow (develop) | 🐙 🛠️ |
| "review X" | Ink workflow (deliver) | 🐙 ✅ |
| "read file.ts" | Claude Read tool (no external CLIs) | (none) |

**Before v7.4:**
```bash
# Had to use CLI commands
./scripts/orchestrate.sh probe "research OAuth patterns"
./scripts/orchestrate.sh tangle "implement auth system"
```

**v7.4+:**
```
# Just talk naturally
"Research OAuth authentication patterns"
"Build a user authentication system"
```

📖 **[Complete Triggers Guide →](docs/TRIGGERS.md)**

### What Else Changed

- ✅ Debate skill accessible via natural language ("run a debate about X")
- ✅ Hook-based visual indicators (PreToolUse hooks)
- ✅ Four workflow skills (probe, grasp, tangle, ink) with natural language triggers
- ✅ Enhanced parallel-agents.md with visual indicators section
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation (VISUAL-INDICATORS.md, TRIGGERS.md)

## ✨ What's New in v7.2 - Quick Knowledge Mode Toggle

**Instant mode switching for code vs research!** Toggle between Development Mode (code-focused) and Knowledge Work Mode (research, UX, strategy) with a single command.

### Quick Toggle
Switch modes instantly in Claude Code:
```
/claude-octopus:km on      # Enable knowledge work mode
/claude-octopus:km off     # Enable development mode
/claude-octopus:km         # Check current status
```

### Natural Language
Or just tell me:
- "Switch to knowledge mode"
- "Enable research mode"
- "What mode am I in?"

I'll detect and switch automatically! ✨

### What Changes
| Aspect | Dev Mode 🔧 | Knowledge Mode 🎓 |
|--------|------------|-------------------|
| **Default Tasks** | Code, test, debug | Research, strategy, UX |
| **Debate Style** | Technical (code-focused) | Strategic (business-focused) |
| **Document Export** | Code docs, API specs | Reports, presentations, proposals |
| **Quality Gates** | Security, performance | Insight depth, evidence quality |

## Which Tentacle Does What?

Claude Octopus has different "tentacles" (workflows) for different tasks:

| Tentacle | When to Use | What It Does | Example |
|----------|-------------|--------------|---------|
| **🔍 Probe** | Research, explore, investigate | Multi-AI research and discovery | "Research OAuth 2.0 patterns" |
| **🎯 Grasp** | Define, clarify, scope | Requirements and problem definition | "Define requirements for auth system" |
| **🛠️ Tangle** | Build, implement, create | Multi-AI implementation approaches | "Build user authentication" |
| **✅ Ink** | Review, validate, audit | Quality assurance and validation | "Review auth code for security" |
| **🐙 Debate** | Debate, discuss, deliberate | Structured 3-way AI debates | "Run a debate about Redis vs Memcached" |

**Natural language automatically activates the right tentacle!**

- 🟡 Gemini CLI: Google AI costs (Gemini Pro)
- Typical costs: $0.01-0.10 per query

**Claude subagents are included:**
- 🔵 Claude Code Task tool: No additional cost
- Included with your Claude Code subscription

**When to use external CLIs (🐙):**
- Need multiple perspectives on a problem
- Research requires broad coverage
- Complex implementation needs different approaches
- Security review benefits from adversarial analysis
- High-stakes decisions

**When to use Claude only (no indicator):**
- Simple file operations
- Single perspective adequate
- Quick edits or fixes
- Cost efficiency important
- Straightforward tasks

📖 **[Visual Indicators Guide](docs/VISUAL-INDICATORS.md)** - Complete cost breakdown

## Acknowledgments

Claude Octopus stands on the shoulders of giants:

- **[wolverin0/claude-skills](https://github.com/wolverin0/claude-skills)** by **wolverin0** - AI Debate Hub enables structured three-way debates between Claude, Gemini CLI, and Codex CLI. Integrated as a git submodule with claude-octopus enhancements (quality gates, cost tracking, document export). wolverin0's innovative "Claude as participant" design pattern is brilliant—Claude doesn't just orchestrate, it actively debates. This integration demonstrates proper open-source collaboration: clear attribution, hybrid approach (original + enhancement layer), and a path to contribute improvements back upstream. MIT License.

- **[obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers)** by **Jesse Vincent** - Several discipline skills (TDD, systematic debugging, verification, planning, branch finishing) were inspired by the excellent patterns in this Claude Code skills library. The "Iron Law" enforcement approach and anti-rationalization techniques are particularly valuable. MIT License.

- **Double Diamond** methodology by the [UK Design Council](https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/our-resources/the-double-diamond/) - The probe/grasp/tangle/ink workflow structure provides a proven framework for divergent and convergent thinking in design and development.
